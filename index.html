              <h1>Docker Secrets - A Detailed Beginners Guide</h1>
              <p>
                Even if you've used Docker before for smaller or locally produced applications, it can be difficult to use for more sophisticated tasks. This is especially true when it comes to secret management and sharing, which are aspects that are sometimes disregarded when working with containerized apps.  There is no standard method for getting and managing secrets in containers, resulting in haphazard or ineffective solutions better suited to more static Docker secrets environment variables. Docker secrets, fortunately, are a terrific solution provided by the Docker community.

              <p>
                The majority of Kubernetes-deployed apps need access to databases, services, and other resources that are hosted outside of their network. Using Kubernetes secrets to handle the login details required to access such resources is the simplest method. Secrets assist in cluster organization and distribution of sensitive data. You will discover what Kubernetes secrets are and how to build and use them in your cluster in this blog.
